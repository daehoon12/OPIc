# Q. You indicated in the survey that you stay at home for vacations. Who are the people you would like to see and spend time with on your vacation.  (Description, habit)

# A. 
Vacations at home... alright.  
Um, I'm living with my family, uh, at home.  

<br/>

So, whether I like it or not, I have to see my family during vacation.  
Um, and it made me so annoyed because, as I already told you before, I'm not that outgoing person.  

<br/>

So, I prefer to spend my own time rather than spendin time with someone.  
So, I prefer the things like, um just seeing Youtube.. watching Youtube...

<br/>

But with family it's so hard because, yeah, my family always wants to keep talking with me.  
And so, I really hope i can buy my own house in the future.

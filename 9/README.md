# Transportation

1. **No matter what, whenever I** need to go somewhere,  
   **I always** take the "subway or bus."  
2. **This is crucial.** (= important) 
    It's quite **rare** for me to take other options.  
3. **I low "how" (What I really love about)** I can read something while taking the public transit.  
   -> **What I really love about** reading something while taking the public transit. 도 가능  
4. It's the only time I can **actually** read! (3,4는 프리스타일)  
5. It's interesting **cos I've never like readding before. (과거)**  
6. **I still don't (현재, Quick Comparison)**, but **I love how it helps me to kill time.**  


# Recycling  
1. **Every time I** need to recycling.  
   **I always check to see that** all the cans and plastic bottles are crushed to save space.  
2. **It's very important.** **It's really rare** for me to forget to check.  
3. **I'm quite lazy.** So I hate having to recycle.  
4. I take out the recycling only when my bins are **full to the max.** (Freestyle)  
5. It's interesting **cos I had to recycle nearly everyday before. (Qucik Comparison, 과거)**  
6. **But, now,** with my new method of crushing everything, I recycle every 2 weeks. (다시 현재)

한가지로만 설명하는게 가장 중요!


# Appointment  
1. **I'll tell you what**, **I always** make a hair appointment pretty much every month. (Pretty much : 거의)  
2. **I find this** very important. It's very **rare** for me to skip a hair-cut.  
3. Of course, I make other appointment as well in my life, but this one is the most important to me.  
4. My hair is always curly, So I need it to be well maintained! (Freestyle)  
5. **It's interesting cos** I never cared about my hair before.  
6. But these days, I feel (that) my hair gives me confidence.

# Q. Describe the home you lived in as a child. How was that home different from the home you live in now?

- A. 
My childhood's home...  

<br/>

Oh, actually I can't remember very specifically, but one thing I just remember very clearly it was so huge house.  
Sofa, furnitures, chairs, desks.. everything was so huge. So big.  
It's feels like I was a ant.  

<br/>

Because I think I was a little girl that's why I feeled like everything was so big.  

## Comparison Strategy  
- Main Point (Pure present), 과거에 대해서 얘기하지 말기
ex) I live by myself in a normal looking apartment.
    I would say it's pretty small, but I love how big my washroom is.
  
 - Main Point 다음에 과거를 말한다.  
 - 그리고 다시 현재로 돌아와서 부가 설명 뒤에 결론.
 ex) 나는 아파트에 살어. 작지만 화장실은 커. 과거에 살던 곳은 화장실이 작아서 슬펐어. 하지만 지금 화장실은 크고 아름다워. so big that I wash my body twice.  
 
that's reason. I love my home.

# Q. Describe the home you lived in as a child. How was that home different from the home you live in now?

- A. 
My childhood's home...  

<br/>

Oh, actually I can't remember very specifically, but one thing I just remember very clearly it was so huge house.  
Sofa, furnitures, chairs, desks.. everything was so huge. So big.  
It's feels like I was a ant. 
Because I think I was a little girl that's why I feeled like everything was so big. 

<br/>

Now, I'm live in more big house.  
But I'm still need more place  
 
## Comparison Strategy  
- Main Point (Pure present), 과거에 대해서 얘기하지 말기
ex) I live by myself in a normal looking apartment.
    I would say it's pretty small, but I love how big my washroom is.
  
 - Main Point 다음에 과거를 말한다.  
 - 그리고 다시 현재로 돌아와서 부가 설명 뒤에 결론.
 ex) 나는 아파트에 살어. 작지만 화장실은 커. 과거에 살던 곳은 화장실이 작아서 슬펐어. 하지만 지금 화장실은 크고 아름다워. it's so big that i sometimes take a shower twice in a day. That's reason. I love my home.

3. It's feels like I was a ant.  
- I truly felt like an ant (1~3 Past)  
4. Because I think I was a little girl that's why I feeled like everything was so big.  
- feeled -> felt  (think, felt 감정을 보여줌)
5. Now, I'm live in more big house.
- Now, I'm living in an even bigger home!.  
6. But I'm still need more place  
- But I'm still feel like I need more space (feel like 감정)  
7. I feels it's not bigger than when I kid is.  
- My place is big, but I still want a bigger place.  
8. Oh maybe I'm growing so that's why I feels like it.  
- Oh, maybe I'm growing so my perspective is changing. (perspective : 관점)

## The Quick Comparison Method

## Example  
Q. What do you usually do whenever you go to the bank?  

A.  
**Well. here's the thing.**  
**Whenever I go to the bank.  
I always make sure to bring my airpods.** (Main Point)  
You know. this is very **crucial** because sometimes the waiting is just so long.  
And so. whenever I'm listening to the music. it really helps me to kill time.  
**But you see. in the past, I never did that before.  
so the waiting time was just so long.** (Quick Comparison, 동사가 과거형이다!)  
And that is why. you know.  
Sometimes, whenever I go to the bank  
I sometimes want the waiting time to be longer  
because I really enjoy my music. (결론)  

### Transportation

**This is crucual.**  
It's quite **rare** for me to take other option.  
**I love how** I can read something while takeing the public transit. (What I really love about도 가능)   
It's the only time I can actually read! (Free Style)  
It's interesting cos I'**ve never liked** reading **before**.  
I **still** don't, but I love how it helps me to kill time especially while I'm commuting. (Quick Comparison)

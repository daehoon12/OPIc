## Example  
Q. What do you usually do whenever you go to the bank?  

A.  
**Well. here's the thing.**  
**Whenever I go to the bank.  
I always make sure to bring my airpods.** (Main Point)  
You know. this is very **crucial** because sometimes the waiting is just so long.  
And so. whenever I'm listening to the music. it really helps me to kill time.  
**But you see. in the past, I never did that before.  
so the waiting time was just so long.** (Quick Comparison, 동사가 과거형이다!)  
And that is why. you know.  
Sometime, whenever I go to the bank  
I sometimes want the waiting time to be longer  
because I really enjoy my music. (결론)
